# Game Pie
The game pie was a 2 week event in which we had to design and develop a small game. In this time we had to make a 1 page document, this had to contain our groups idea for the game, mechanics, genre and storyline. Next we had to swap our 1 page document with a different group and make a 10 page document based on their 1 page document. Once this was done we got back the 10 page document they had created for us and had 3 days to create our game.
