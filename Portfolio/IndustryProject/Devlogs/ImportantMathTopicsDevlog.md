# How can I find out what the most important math topics for primary school students from grade 7 & 8 are?

Since this game needs to have educational purposes we need to implement relevant subjects, so that our game can be useful to primary schools. 

## How did I solve this?

After getting information from our stakeholder, we started looking at SLO Tule. It was already decided that we were going to focus on math as the topic for our game, so I started looking at the math topics for grade 7 & 8.

With this information all the math topics we thought were needed were picked. After this, me and one other group member came up with some questions to ask primary school teachers about what is important for their pupils. This was so we could verify that we had picked topics that would help the pupils. We wanted to know the most important topics, how to ask the questions and if something like this would be useful.

## What is the result?

Me and my group are now able to implement topics that are relevant and have a difficulty level that is equivalent to the difficulty level of seventh and eighth grade math.

## What is the quality of the result?

With the questions done, I started to interview primary school teachers. The answers I received were expected and confirmed that we had the right topics and chose an important subject (math).

## What is the next step now that I have this result?

Now that the gathered information was confirmed by experts, we can start making minigames that cover these topics.
