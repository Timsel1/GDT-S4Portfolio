# How can I make a math game that encourages players to work together?

The goal for this industry project is to make an educational game that encourages children from 7th and 8th grade to work together toward a goal while also improving their math skills.

## How did I solve this?

Together with my group I started brainstorming about what type of game we want to make. We ended up picking an escape room setting, since this way we could make multiple math puzzles covering different topics while encouraging our players to work together toward the goal of escaping.

(Workshop, Brainstorm)

## What is the result?

We ended up choosing a point and click style game, where players need to solve math equations to obtain keys. We made 4 minigames/math games that the players would have to play to get the keys. The topics we wanted to cover were addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, percentages, decimals, metric units and fractions. The way we wanted to implement the co-op experience is by making each player hold down the button they wanted to add to the answers, this way a player canâ€™t just do everything by themselves. This will help with the game aesthetic we are aiming for which is fellowship.

## What is the quality of the result?

We have shown our ideas to our stakeholders, they thought this was a good idea and would really encourage the players to work together, since they are trying to achieve the same goal. The game has also been tested during playtests and we saw that people were communicating very well, this was also shown in the survey results we gathered.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?

Now that we know what we are going to make and have a green light, we need to interview primary school teachers to make sure we cover the right topic, and have a difficulty that fits with the curriculum.
