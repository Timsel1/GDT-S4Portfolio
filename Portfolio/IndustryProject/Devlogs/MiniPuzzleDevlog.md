# How can we make our game better fit the escape room setting?

Our game is a point and click escape room, but at the moment you only need to go to a different room and immediately solve the main math puzzle. In our second sprint review we received feedback from our teacher to add mini puzzles to actually make our game an escape room.
How did I solve this?

I started brainstorming with my group about what type of mini puzzles to add. Since we had potions in our main room, I came up with the idea to make a plant grow with a potion. This fits well with the theme of our game, since it is played inside of a laboratory of a mad scientist.

(Workshop, Brainstorm)

## What is the result?

We came up with 3 mini puzzles in total. My idea of growing a plant with a potion was expanded upon by my group and got a few extra steps. The full puzzle was to get a red and blue potion to make a purple potion, the player could mix these 2 potions by solving our sum puzzle. Once the players had a purple potion they could drag it to the plant pot to grow the plant, this plant has 1 of 3 keys to open the door.

## What is the quality of the result?

We wanted to make the players feel more immersed in the game, like they were actually in an escape room. We were able to test this during our grand playtest. We gathered the results by asking the players to fill in a survey. We got positive results confirming that these mini puzzles helped us achieve our goal.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?

I will test the game with the target audience to see if they think these puzzles are entertaining to them and make them feel like they are actually in an escape room.
