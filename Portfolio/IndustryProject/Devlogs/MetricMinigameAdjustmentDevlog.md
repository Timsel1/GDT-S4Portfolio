# How can I lower the difficulty of the metric minigame, without changing the core concept?

After our third sprint delivery and some peer feedback, it seemed the metric minigame was too hard. Players had too little time and didn’t always know if they had pressed a button. The numbers were also too high for this short time frame.
(core concept: add 2 or more values together to get the value shown in the middle of the screen)

## How did I solve this?

I brainstormed with my group members and we wrote down the problems and possible solutions. The solutions regarding functionality were, having a number which updates in real time, to see what the players have filled in. This number will convert the filled in values as well. The other solution was to lower the highest number that can be generated. These tasks were assigned to me.

## What is the result?

I ended up lowering the highest number that could be generated (from 100 to 50), making a number that updates with each value you add or subtract from your answer and changing the button color when it is pressed, this made it even more obvious whether you had pressed a button or not (the color will later be changed to fit the game’s aesthetic). The time had to stay the same since the children could otherwise just check all the button combinations, instead of trying to figure out what the answer is.

## What is the quality of the result?

I have tested this with my group members, they were able to get the right answers faster and more consistently with these changes. I also showed this minigame to a primary school teacher, she told me the goal of the game was still unclear, but being able to see what is pressed and being able to see your answer change in real time made the game easier.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?

The next step will be to make the goal of the game clear and to test this with more people and especially people from our target audience.
