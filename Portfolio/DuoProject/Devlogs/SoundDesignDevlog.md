# How can I add sound to the game that fits the menu, coins and dash?

Our game already has a lot of sound effects  but these are the ones that are still missing. 
## How did I solve this?

After the workshops I got about sound design and the assignment I made for this topic, I had a decent understanding of how/what kind of sound to add. Since we are working with corgi I used their sound manager. I didn't know how this worked so I looked up a tutorial about the corgi sound manager and feedback system.  After watching this tutorial I was able to implement the sounds into the game.

#### Sounds

I have added a total of 3 sounds. Coin pickup sound, UI click feedback and a dash. I have made the coin pickup and UI feedback sound myself, the dash sound was found by my duo partner. It was a bit too long, so I cut it to make it fit with the dash timing and implemented it.

I made the coin pickup sound by dropping coins on a blanket, I recorded multiple attempts and chose the one that sounded best.

The UI feedback was made by closing a balisong trainer, which made a metal tick sound. I also recorded multiple attempts of this sound and again chose the best one.

## What is the result?

The game I'm working on now has sounds for everything we are using in the build.

## What is the quality of the result?

I have shown the results to my duo partner and 2 other groups. They have told me that the coin, dash and UI sound are fitting, but you can barely hear them.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?

Now that all the sounds have been added I can start to separate them into different channels and make sure every sound is balanced and none are too loud compared to others.
