How Can I improve the jump with the feedback I received from the first playtest?

We got feedback that our jump mechanic felt weak and spongy. We heard players say this while playing the game and saw this after they filled in the form we had prepared. In this case the level design was also at fault and added to the feeling of having a weak jump.
How did I solve this?

In this game we make use of the corgi engine, corgi has a script that is specifically used for jumping. All I had to do was change the value of the jump power to make it feel a lot better. For now I upped the power by 2, because this is what felt right to me while playing the game. I also made a new level that better fit the character and his new jump power.

(Workshop, Prototyping)
What is the result?

Our jump power has gone up which gives the player more height per jump. This way the jump should match the players expectations better and not feel as spongy.
What is the quality of the result?

The new jump has been tested at the second playtest of our game. The people who had played our game before told me that the jump felt much better and matched their expectations. We were also able to see this in the form we prepared.

What is the next step now that I have this result?

Our jump mechanic is now done and weâ€™ll be using it with this value in our game.
