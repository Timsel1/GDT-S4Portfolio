# How can I create a level that is challenging and aesthetically fits with our theme/setting?

Our game had one level, this level was reliant on triple jumping and didn’t have a clear path. It also didn’t fit with the art style of the character, so our game needed a level that did.
## How did I solve this?

Our game takes place on an unknown planet, we were planning to make different biomes. So I started looking through the asset store to find pixel art assets that matched with our character. I ended up with a cave asset, so I decided to make a cave level.

For this level in our game I wanted to have specific platforming and shooter areas. The main focus in the platforming areas will be hard jumps, there will occasionally be an enemy to make it more difficult for the player. The shooter areas will be more open, there will still be platforms for the player to move around. These areas will contain portals, which spawn enemies based on a timer.

This sketch is the first prototype I came up with. I eventually ended up scrapping the second open area because the level was already hard enough.

## What is the result?

I ended up with a hard platforming level, which has open fighting areas and fits the character’s art style.

## What is the quality of the result?

I showed this level to my duo partner and let people play it during the second playtest. Here I noticed that the level became easier over time for people, but they kept dying in the last area (the boss room), this is what I was aiming for with the short amount of playtime people had. I received positive feedback from my duo partner and the playtesters.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?

The first level I made is finished for now, but I can start making other levels like this one. I want these new levels to focus on certain mechanics in the game, like dashing.
