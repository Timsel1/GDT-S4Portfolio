# How can I make a UI that scales well with the players screen resolution and is simple to understand?

The game me and my duo partner are working on didnâ€™t have any ui except for an fps counter and a health bar. When the game would start the player was instantly put into a level.
## How did I solve this?

I attended a UI design workshop which gave a lot of information about how to make a UI which is scalable and how to use anchor points. I also watched a video with some extra basic information

## What is the result?

I ended up with a simple UI that can scale with the player's resolution. I also added a point and mana counter to the top right corner so the player can keep track of these stats.

## What is the quality of the result?

I have shown the menu UI during the second playtest, at that point there were some bugs, which have been resolved by now. Yet, all of the comments I got about the UI were positive and exactly what I was aiming for.

I have shown the coin and mana counter to my duo partner. He agreed that it was a clear way of showing the mana and coins the player has collected.

## What is the next step now that I have this result?

There are things missing in the main menu like a settings screen, but since this has been added so close to the end of the project I think the menu and UI is finished for now.
